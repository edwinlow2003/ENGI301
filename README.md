## Project Background
This Morse code transceiver allows users to input Morse code with buttons. Users have the option to adjust the pause times between letters and words with a potentiometer. The user can use the blue arcade button to input Morse code. The button will light up and a buzzer will buzz when the user input a dot or a dash (short or long press). The red pushbutton is the delete button in case the user enters a wrong letter. The green pushbutton is the control button for the user to start/stop inputting Morse code. It is also used for transmitting the message if the user presses it for 3 seconds. (As of now, the transmitting function still does not work, so long-pressing the green pushbutton only resets the message string.)
